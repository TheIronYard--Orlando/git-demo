# About the Class

* Brandon is learning to juggle inbetween defining variables and functions. Barely making it, yet making it!

* Lake is really hungry.

* Kevin thinks the class is just the right mix of fear, pain, joy, excitement, heartbreak, and sleepless nights.

* Linsy is killin' it at ping pong.

* Bama recently started a neighborhood watch. He dances naked in his window and all the neighbors watch.

* Ed is often distracted by passing law enforcement, as he is wanted in 12 states and 4 countries.

* Joe is not slow! I think!
