# About the Class

* Brandon has nothing to do but take this class, because he has no outside responsibilities.

* Lake is really hungry.

* Kevin thinks the class is ok, but wishes we could go faster. Lots faster.

* Linsy is killin' it at ping pong.

* Brian has been spoiling the whole class with gourmet meals every Friday.

* Ed is often distracted by passing law enforcement, as he is wanted in 12 states and 4 countries.

* Joe is not slow! I think!
