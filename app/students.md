# About the Class

* Brandon has nothing to do but take this class, because he has no outside responsibilities.

* Lake is really hungry.

* Kevin thinks the class is ok, but wishes we could go faster. Lots faster.

* Linsy stays in the dark room working all the time, because she sucks at ping pong.

* Brian has been spoiling the whole class with gourmet meals every Friday.

* Ed is often distracted by passing law enforcement, as he is wanted in 12 states and 4 countries.

* Joe, affectionately known as "slow Joe", is doing what he can, and we all hope for the best.
